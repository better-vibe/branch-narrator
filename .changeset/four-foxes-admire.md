Expand `dump-diff --patch-for` to support folder paths in addition to single files, including recursive matching of changed files under the selected directory.

Also add `location` to `branch-narrator cache stats` output so users can see the active cache directory, and clarify cache/snapshot storage locations across global, bunx, npx, and local invocation modes.
