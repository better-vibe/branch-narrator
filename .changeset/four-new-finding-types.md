Add 4 new Finding types for expanded analysis support:

- **CypressConfigFinding** - For E2E test configuration and test file changes
- **I18nChangeFinding** - For translation key and locale changes
- **WebSocketChangeFinding** - For WebSocket/Socket.io event and room changes
- **CSSChangeFinding** - For CSS Module and styling changes

These new finding types enable analyzers to report detailed information about changes in testing (Cypress), internationalization, real-time communication, and styling domains.
