# branch-narrator CLI Reference

> **⚠️ META: This is branch-narrator's own codebase.**
>
> When running branch-narrator commands here, you are testing the tool on itself.
> If output is inaccurate, incomplete, or missing expected information, treat it
> as a **bug to fix** in the tool's source code—not a limitation to work around.
>
> Run `bun dist/cli.js` (after `bun run build`) to test local changes.

Use `branch-narrator` to get deterministic, repo-grounded context about changes
between git refs. It does not use an LLM and will not invent intent.

## Quick Start

Run `branch-narrator --help` for all options.

## Commands

### facts (Primary)

Get structured JSON analysis of changes. This is the primary command for understanding what changed.

**When to use:**
- User asks for a PR description or summary of changes
- You need structured data about routes, endpoints, dependencies, or config changes
- You want to understand the scope of modifications

**Example:**
```bash
branch-narrator facts --mode branch --base main --head HEAD
```

**Output:** JSON with categorized findings including file summaries, route changes, dependency updates, environment variables, and more.

---

### risk-report

Get a risk score (0-100) with evidence-backed security and stability flags.

**When to use:**
- User asks about security implications or risks
- Before merging changes that touch sensitive areas (auth, DB, infra)
- When reviewing PRs for potential issues

**Example:**
```bash
branch-narrator risk-report --mode branch --base main --head HEAD
```

**Output:** Risk score with categorized flags (high/medium/low) and evidence for each flag.

---

### zoom

Drill into a specific finding or risk flag by its stable ID.

**When to use:**
- You need more details about a specific finding from `facts`
- You want to understand a risk flag from `risk-report`
- You need to cite specific evidence in a PR description

**Examples:**
```bash
# Zoom into a finding
branch-narrator zoom --finding <id> --mode branch --base main

# Zoom into a risk flag
branch-narrator zoom --flag <id> --mode branch --base main
```

**Output:** Detailed information about the specific finding or flag, including file paths and line-level context.

---

### dump-diff

Get filtered diff output for line-level code review context.

**When to use:**
- You need raw diff content for precise code analysis
- Writing detailed PR descriptions that cite specific lines
- When `facts` doesn't provide enough detail

**Example:**
```bash
branch-narrator dump-diff --mode branch --base main --head HEAD --unified 3 --out .ai/diff.txt
```

**Output:** Unified diff written to the specified file, filtered to exclude noise (lockfiles, generated files).

---

### snap

Save and restore workspace snapshots for safe experimentation.

**When to use:**
- Before making risky or experimental changes
- When you want a restore point during complex refactoring
- To compare workspace states

**Examples:**
```bash
# Save current state
branch-narrator snap save "before-refactor"

# List saved snapshots
branch-narrator snap list

# Restore a snapshot
branch-narrator snap restore <id>

# Show snapshot details
branch-narrator snap show <id>

# Compare two snapshots
branch-narrator snap diff <idA> <idB>
```

## Decision Tree

Use this to decide which command to run:

```
User asks to understand changes     → run `facts`
User asks about risks/security      → run `risk-report`
Need details on specific item       → run `zoom --finding <id>` or `zoom --flag <id>`
Need raw diff for code review       → run `dump-diff`
Before risky/experimental changes   → run `snap save`
```

## Common Workflows

### PR Description
1. Run `facts --mode branch --base main --head HEAD`
2. Run `dump-diff --mode branch --base main --head HEAD --out .ai/diff.txt`
3. Use the structured facts and diff to write the PR description

### Risk Review
1. Run `risk-report --mode branch --base main --head HEAD`
2. For high-severity flags, run `zoom --flag <id>` to get details
3. Summarize risks with evidence citations

### Code Review Context
1. Run `facts` for overview
2. Run `dump-diff` for specific file changes
3. Use `zoom` for detailed investigation of specific findings

## Default Behavior

- **Mode:** Defaults to `unstaged` (local uncommitted changes) if no mode specified
- **Base/Head:** For branch mode, defaults to `main` and `HEAD` if not specified
- **For PR descriptions:** Always use `--mode branch`
